    ### Energy (Calories)
    - **Daily Requirement**: The average adult requires about 2000-2500 kcal per day. This varies based on age, gender, activity level, and individual metabolic rate.
    - **Insight**: The products in the dataset seem to provide a significant amount of energy, often around 400-500 kcal per serving. This is about 20-25% of the daily requirement, so consumption should be moderate to avoid excessive calorie intake, especially if these are snacks or non-meal items.

    ### Protein
    - **Daily Requirement**: The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 46 grams per day for adult women and 56 grams per day for adult men.
    - **Insight**: Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. The products in the dataset generally provide between 5-10 grams per serving, which is about 10-20% of the daily requirement. This makes them a moderate source of protein.

    ### Carbohydrates
    - **Daily Requirement**: Carbohydrates should make up about 45-65% of your total daily calories. For a 2000 kcal diet, this amounts to about 225-325 grams per day.
    - **Insight**: Many of these products are carbohydrate-dense, with around 70 grams per serving. This is about 20-30% of the daily requirement and should be balanced with other sources of carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

    ### Sugars (Total and Added)
    - **Daily Limit**: The WHO recommends that free sugars (added sugars and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices) should be less than 10% of total energy intake. For a 2000 kcal diet, this is about 50 grams of sugar per day.
    - **Insight**: Many products have around 7 grams of total sugars, with varying amounts of added sugars. Keeping added sugar intake low is crucial to prevent health issues like obesity and tooth decay.

    ### Dietary Fiber
    - **Daily Requirement**: The RDA for dietary fiber is 25 grams per day for adult women and 38 grams per day for adult men.
    - **Insight**: Fiber is vital for digestive health. The products in the dataset generally have about 2 grams of fiber, which is around 5-10% of the daily requirement. Itâ€™s important to consume more fiber-rich foods like vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains.

    ### Fats (Total, Saturated, and Trans Fat)
    - **Total Fat**: Should constitute 20-35% of your total daily calories. For a 2000 kcal diet, this is about 44-78 grams per day.
    - **Saturated Fat**: Should be less than 10% of total daily calories. For a 2000 kcal diet, this is about 20 grams per day.
    - **Trans Fat**: Should be kept as low as possible, ideally less than 1% of total daily calories (about 2 grams per day for a 2000 kcal diet).
    - **Insight**: Many products in the dataset have high total and saturated fat content. Keeping saturated and trans fats low is important to reduce the risk of heart disease.

    ### Cholesterol
    - **Daily Limit**: The American Heart Association recommends consuming less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day.
    - **Insight**: Some products may have cholesterol content, though it's often not listed. Monitoring intake from other sources like eggs, meat, and dairy is important.

    ### Sodium
    - **Daily Limit**: The American Heart Association recommends no more than 2300 milligrams of sodium per day, with an ideal limit of 1500 milligrams for most adults.
    - **Insight**: High sodium intake can lead to hypertension and other cardiovascular issues. Itâ€™s important to balance sodium intake from processed foods with fresh, whole foods.

    ### Iron and Calcium
    - **Iron**: The RDA for iron is 18 mg per day for adult women and 8 mg per day for adult men.
    - **Calcium**: The RDA for calcium is 1000 mg per day for most adults.
    - **Insight**: Adequate iron is important for preventing anemia, and calcium is crucial for bone health. The products in the dataset provide varying amounts of these minerals, so a balanced diet including other sources like leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and dairy is important.
